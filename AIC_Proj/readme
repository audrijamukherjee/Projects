1. real_articles_get_urls - stores URLs of real news articles as output1.csv
2. real_articles - Parses the articles from the URLs and stores 'url','authors','date','title','summary','content','keywords' in FullData_Real_News.tsv
3. clean real_news - stores before_clean_real.npy for valid real articles, makes bag of words model for them, stores as Real_clean.npy
4. clean_fake_news - stores before_clean_fake.npy for valid real articles, makes bag of words model for them, stores as Feal_clean.npy
5. create_train_test - combines real, fake cleaned content, labels, trains the model, has test set prediction method for 500 test samples and queryfakeness for single query
6. results - writes the output in nice format 'URL','Content','Cleaned_Content','True_labels','Predicted_labels','Confidence' to Results.csv (for test dataset)

Supporting files for quick execution - before_clean_fake.npy, before_clean_real.npy, Fake_clean.npy, Real_clean.npy, SVC.pkl
