Project 2: LSTMs for Language Detection

SW required: Python 2.7, tf 1.0.1

Instructions to Run the code: The code is pretty well documented into blocks and comments explaining each block are given in 
the ipython notebook.

Part 1 of this blog explains implementation of how to build string scoring models and then combine them into a single language detector. In Part 2, we explore extensions and possible improvements to the model(s). The languages used are English and French.

Part 1: 
Implemented the String Scoring Models for both English and French
Combined them into a single language detector
Answered the necessary questions and justified the results with explanation.

Part 2:
Experimented with various parameter tuning in the the LSTM models.
Explored early stopping on the validation dataset
Explored N-grams model and compared the results with the LSTMs model.


- Open the ipython notebook and run the cells in order to train the model and obtain the necessary results.
