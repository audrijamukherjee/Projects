The code for Part 1 currently runs for 120 epochs
The code for Part 2 runs for 10 epochs and takes a while to run. I have confirmed with the lead TA for project 6 that the run time for Part 2 has no constraint and there will be no penalty for a long runtime. 

As mentioned in the project description- Handing In section, the code folder contains only the 6 source files: proj6_part1.m, proj6_part1_cnn_init.m, proj6_part1_setup_data.m, proj6_part2.m, proj6_part2_cnn_init.m, and proj6_part2_setup_data.m.

No MatConvNet, data or imagenet-vgg-f.mat present.

Final Part 1 accuracy after solving all 4 problems(120 epochs) = 0.5653 (lowest validation error=0.4346)
Final Part 2 accuracy(10 epochs) = 0.878 (lowest validation error=0.122)

Thanks and have fun grading the last project.
