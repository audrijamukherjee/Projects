• Applied Google word2vec (pre-trained and retrained model) with bag of centroids to featurize IMDB movie reviews.
• Compared results with features obtained from LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) topic modelling, by testing on 25000 movie
reviews using Random Forests for predicting positive or negative sentiment of reviews.
• Inferred that retrained Google word2vec model gives best predictions for this dataset.
